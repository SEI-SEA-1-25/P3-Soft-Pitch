## Notes:
`First, create an API of our own hotels (3-5) and assign them with different specialties (one better with senior dogs, or dogs with disabilities, etc) - Users can select where to place their dog from that list.
Develop a calendar booking system - each hotel can hold x amount of dogs a night (stretch)`
