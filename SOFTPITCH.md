# 4. What technologies you plan on using"

We will be using mernAuth to keep the user's data private. We will use mongodb to hard code in the answers to the magic 8-ball, which will then be generate randomly in javascript. The Crystal Ball will be linked to a free API. All the user's info will be save in the mongodb. We will code in react, and use css to style the front end.

# 5. What your current status is on the project (including demos of the APIs and techs you would like to use):

We have not begun, but we are narrowing down what exactly this project will entail. If we reach MVP, we'd like to use Canvas and create an overall visual theme. 2 API's that may work for are crystal ball are helloacm/fortune (a free download that populates your database) or furtunecookie.com api.
